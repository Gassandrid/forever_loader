### Info:
Just a fun little animation to play on your command line when you are not doing anything! Please feel free to add new options through the EventOptions struct or make your own entirely.

### Quick Notes:
- The Text files are set to the `/usr/local/bin` directory so that when the program is built, and you move it into that folder, you can easily run it as a command line app.

### Future Additions:
- Alternative loading bars with more color similar to common package managers like `pip` and `npm`
- more interactive input options from the user
	- ability to name certain elements and see those elements reappear when loading later
